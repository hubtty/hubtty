# This is an example ~/.config/ghubtty/ghubtty.yaml file for use with
# installations of Github running on googlesource.com. Most of these options
# are not required, rather, they customize Ghubtty to better deal with the

# This file does not list all of the available options.  For a full

  # Match Github change ids, and replace them with a link to an
  # internal Ghubtty search for that change id.

# This section defines customized dashboards.  You can supply any

# NB: "recentlyseen:24 hours" does not just return changes seen in the
# last 24 hours -- it returns changes seen within 24 hours of the most
# recently seen change.  So you can take the weekend off and pick up

# Reviewkeys are hotkeys that perform immediate reviews within the
# change screen.  Any pending comments or review messages will be
# attached to the review; otherwise an empty review will be left.  The
# approvals list is exhaustive, so if you specify an empty list,
# Ghubtty will submit a review that clears any previous approvals.  To
# submit the change with the review, include 'submit: True' with the
# reviewkey.  Reviewkeys appear in the help text for the change
# screen.
