Configuration
-------------

Hubtty uses a YAML based configuration file that it looks for at
``~/.config/hubtty/hubtty.yaml``.  Several sample configuration files
are included.  You can find them in the examples/ directory of the
`source distribution
<https://opendev.org/ttygroup/hubtty/src/branch/master/examples>`_ or
the share/hubtty/examples directory after installation.

Select one of the sample config files, copy it to ~/.config/hubtty/hubtty.yaml
and edit as necessary.  Search for ``CHANGEME`` to find parameters that need to
be supplied.  The sample config files are as follows:

**minimal-hubtty.yaml**
  Only contains the parameters required for Hubtty to actually run.

**reference-hubtty.yaml**
  An exhaustive list of all supported options with examples.

**openshift-hubtty.yaml**
  A configuration designed for OpenShift reviews.

Hubtty uses local git repositories to perform much of its work.  These
can be the same git repositories that you use when developing a
project.  Hubtty will not alter the working directory or index unless
you request it to (and even then, the usual git safeguards against
accidentally losing work remain in place).  You will need to supply
the name of a directory where Hubtty will find or clone git
repositories for your projects as the ``git-root`` parameter.

The config file is designed to support multiple Github instances.  The
first one is used by default, but others can be specified by supplying
the name on the command line.

Configuration Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following describes the values that may be set in the
configuration file.

Servers
+++++++

This section lists the servers that Hubtty can talk to.  Multiple
servers may be listed; by default, Hubtty will use the first one
listed.  To select another, simply specify its name on the command
line.

**servers**
  A list of server definitions.  The format of each entry is described
  below.

  **name (required)**
    A name that describes the server, to reference on the command
    line.

  **url**
    The URL of the Github server.  HTTPS should be preferred.
    Defaults to https://github.com/.

  **api-url**
    The URL of the Github API server.  HTTPS should be preferred.
    Defaults to https://api.github.com/.

  **git-url**
    The URL to clone git repos. By default, <url> is used. For a list
    of valid URLs, see:
    https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-clone.html#URLS
    Set git-url to ssh://git@github.com in order to clone private repos.

  **git-root (required)**
    A location where Hubtty should store its git repositories.  These
    can be the same git repositories where you do your own work --
    Hubtty will not modify them unless you tell it to, and even then
    the normal git protections against losing work remain in place.

  **dburi**
    The location of Hubtty's sqlite database.  If you have more than
    one server, you should specify a dburi for any additional servers.
    By default a SQLite database called $XDG_DATA_HOME/hubtty/hubtty.db
    is used.

  **log-file**
    By default Hubtty logs errors to a file and truncates that file
    each time it starts (so that it does not grow without bound).  If
    you would like to log to a different location, you may specify it
    with this option.

  **socket**
    Hubtty listens on a unix domain socket for remote commands at
    $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hubtty.sock.  This option may be used to change the path.

  **lock-file**
    Hubtty uses a lock file per server to prevent multiple processes
    from running at the same time. The default is
    $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hubtty.servername.lock

  **additional-repositories**
    By default hubtty lists all repositories to which the user has explicit
    permission.  You can add extra repositories to this list using the
    additional-repositories.

Example:

.. code-block: yaml
   servers:
     - name: CHANGEME
       git-root: ~/git/

Palettes
++++++++

Hubtty comes with two palettes defined internally.  The default
palette is suitable for use on a terminal with a dark background.  The
`light` palette is for a terminal with a white or light background.
You may customize the colors in either of those palettes, or define
your own palette.

If any color is not defined in a palette, the value from the default
palette is used.  The values are a list of at least two elements
describing the colors to be used for the foreground and background.
Additional elements may specify (in order) the color to use for
monochrome terminals, the foreground, and background colors to use in
high-color terminals.

For a reference of possible color names, see the `Urwid Manual
<http://urwid.org/manual/displayattributes.html#foreground-and-background-settings>`_

To see the list of possible palette entries, run `hubtty --print-palette`.

The following example alters two colors in the default palette, one
color in the light palette, and one color in a custom palette.

.. code-block: yaml
   palettes:
     - name: default
       added-line: ['dark green', '']
       added-word: ['light green', '']
     - name: light
       filename: ['dark cyan', '']
     - name: custom
       filename: ['light yellow', '']

Palettes may be selected at runtime with the `-p PALETTE` command
line option, or you may set the default palette in the config file.

**palette**
  This option specifies the default palette.

Keymaps
+++++++

Keymaps work the same way as palettes.  Two keymaps are defined
internally, the `default` keymap and the `vi` keymap.  Individual keys
may be overridden and custom keymaps defined and selected in the
config file or the command line.

Each keymap contains a mapping of command -> key(s).  If a command is
not specified, Hubtty will use the keybinding specified in the default
map.  More than one key can be bound to a command.

Run `hubtty --print-keymap` for a list of commands that can be bound.

The following example modifies the `default` keymap:

.. code-block: yaml
   keymaps:
     - name: default
       diff: 'd'
     - name: custom
       review: ['r', 'R']
     - name: osx #OS X blocks ctrl+o
       pr-search: 'ctrl s'


To specify a sequence of keys, they must be a list of keystrokes
within a list of key series.  For example:

.. code-block: yaml
   keymaps:
     - name: vi
       quit: [[':', 'q']]

The default keymap may be selected with the `-k KEYMAP` command line
option, or in the config file.

**keymap**
  Set the default keymap.

Commentlinks
++++++++++++

Commentlinks are regular expressions that are applied to commit and
review messages.  They can be replaced with internal or external
links, or have colors applied.
Replacement are applied in order.

**commentlinks**
  This is a list of commentlink patterns.  Each commentlink pattern is
  a dictionary with the following values:

  **match**
    A regular expression to match against the text of commit or review
    messages.

  **replacements**
    A list of replacement actions to apply to any matches found.
    Several replacement actions are supported, and each accepts
    certain options.  These options may include strings extracted from
    the regular expression match in named groups by enclosing the
    group name in '{}' braces.

  The following replacement actions are supported:

    **text**
      Plain text whose color may be specified.

      **text**
        The replacement text.

      **color**
        The color in which to display the text.  This references a
        palette entry.

    **link**
      A hyperlink with the indicated text that when activated will
      open the user's browser with the supplied URL

      **text**
        The replacement text.

      **url**
        The color in which to display the text.  This references a
        palette entry.

    **search**
      A hyperlink that will perform a Hubtty search when activated.

      **text**
        The replacement text.

      **query**
        The search query to use.

This example matches Github usernames, and replaces them with a link
to an internal Hubtty search for pull requests authored by that user.

.. code-block: yaml
   commentlinks:
     - match: "(?P<mention_str>[^\\w]@(?P<username>[\\w-]+))"
       replacements:
         - search:
             text: "{mention_str}"
             query: "author:{username}"

Pull Request List Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

**pr-list-query**
  This is the query used for the list of pull requests when a repository is
  selected.  The default is `state:open`.

**pr-list-options**
  This section defines default sorting options for the pull request list.

  **sort-by**
    This key specifies the sort order, which can be `number` (the
    pull request number), `updated` (when the pull request was last updated), or
    `last-seen` (when the pull request was last opened in Hubtty).

  **reverse**
    This is a boolean value which indicates whether the list should be
    in ascending (`true`) or descending (`false`) order.

Example:

.. code-block: yaml
   pr-list-options:
     sort-by: 'number'
     reverse: false

Pull Request View Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

**hide-comments**
  This is a list of descriptors which cause matching comments to be
  hidden by default.  Press the `t` key to toggle the display of
  matching comments.

The only supported criterion is `author`.

  **author**
    A regular expression to match against the comment author's name.

For example, to hide comments from a CI system:

.. code-block: yaml

   hide-comments:
     - author: "^(.*CI|Jenkins)$"

**diff-view**
  Specifies how patch diffs should be displayed.  The values `unified`
  or `side-by-side` (the default) are supported.

**close-pr-on-review**
  When a review is saved, close the pull request view and pop up to the
  previous screen, which will be the pull request list for the repo.

Dashboards
++++++++++

This section defines customized dashboards.  You may supply any
Hubtty search string and bind them to any key.  They will appear in
the global help text, and pressing the key anywhere in Hubtty will
run the query and display the results.

**dashboards**
  A list of dashboards, the format of which is described below.

  **name**
    The name of the dashboard.  This will be displayed in the status
    bar at the top of the screen.

  **query**
    The search query to perform to gather pull requests to be listed in the
    dashboard.

  **key**
    The key to which the dashboard should be bound.

Example:

.. code-block: yaml

   dashboards:
     - name: "My pull requests"
       query: "author:self state:open"
       key: "f2"

Reviewkeys
++++++++++

Reviewkeys are hotkeys that perform immediate reviews within the
pull request screen.  Any pending comments or review messages will be
attached to the review; otherwise an empty review message will be
left.
Reviewkeys appear in the help text for the pull request screen.

**reviewkeys**
  A list of reviewkey definitions, the format of which is described
  below.

  **key**
    This key to which this review action should be bound.

  **approval**
    The status for the approval. Must be one of REQUEST_CHANGES, COMMENT, or
    APPROVE.

  **message**
    Optional, it can be used to include a message during the review.

  **description**
    Optional, changes the description for the reviewkey in the help message.

  **draft**
    Optional, keep the review as a draft and don't submit it right away.

  **merge**
    Optional, merge the pull request directly.


The following example includes a reviewkey that leaves a "/retest" message on
a review, one that approves the PR, and another one that creates a draft message
requesting for changes.

.. code-block: yaml

    reviewkeys:
      - key: 'meta 0'
        approval: 'COMMENT'
        message: "/retest"
      - key: 'meta 1'
        approval: 'APPROVE'
        message: ":shipit:"
        description: 'Approve pull request'
      - key: 'meta 2'
        approval: 'APPROVE'
        message: ":shipit:"
        merge: true
        description: 'Approve pull request and merge'
      - key: 'meta 3'
        approval: 'REQUEST_CHANGES'
        message: "Please add unit tests"
        description: 'Request unit tests'
        draft: True

General Options
+++++++++++++++

**breadcrumbs**
  Hubtty displays a footer at the bottom of the screen by default
  which contains navigation information in the form of "breadcrumbs"
  -- short descriptions of previous screens, with the right-most entry
  indicating the screen that will be displayed if you press the `ESC`
  key.  To disable this feature, set this value to `false`.

**display-times-in-utc**
  Times are displayed in the local timezone by default.  To display
  them in UTC instead, set this value to `true`.

**handle-mouse**
  Hubtty handles mouse input by default.  If you don't want it
  interfering with your terminal's mouse handling, set this value to
  `false`.

**expire-age**
  By default, closed pull requests that are older than two months are
  removed from the local database (and their refs are removed from the
  local git repos so that git may garbage collect them).  If you would
  like to change the expiration delay or disable it, uncomment the
  following line.  The time interval is specified in the same way as
  the "age:" term in Github's search syntax.  To disable it
  altogether, set the value to the empty string.

**size-column**
  By default, the size column is a pair of stacked logarithmic graphs.
  The top, red graph represents the number of lines removed, the
  bottom, green graph the number added.  For an alternate
  representation, use this setting.

  **type**
    A string with one of the following values:

    **graph**
      The default stacked bar graphs.

    **split-graph**
      Rather than vertically stacked, the bar graphs are side-by-side

    **number**
      A single number which represents the number of lines changed
      (added and removed).

  **thresholds**
    A list of integers to determine the magnitude of the graph
    increments, or the color coding of the number.  If the type is
    ``graph`` or ``split-graph``, the list should be four elements
    long.  The default is 1, 10, 100, 1000 for a logarithmic
    representation.  If the type is ``number``, the list should be
    eight elements long; the default in that case is 1, 10, 100, 200,
    400, 600, 800, 1000.

Example:

.. code-block: yaml

   size-column:
     type: graph
     thresholds: [1, 10, 100, 1000]
