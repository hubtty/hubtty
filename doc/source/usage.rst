Usage
-----

After installing Hubtty, you should be able to run it by invoking
``hubtty``.  If you installed it in a virtualenv, you can invoke it
without activating the virtualenv with ``/path/to/venv/bin/hubtty``
which you may wish to add to your shell aliases.  Use ``hubtty
--help`` to see a list of command line options available.

Once Hubtty is running, you will need to start by subscribing to some
repositories.  Use 'L' to list all of the repositories and then 's' to
subscribe to the ones you are interested in.  Hit 'L' again to shrink
the list to your subscribed repositories.

In general, pressing the F1 key will show help text on any screen, and
ESC will take you to the previous screen.

Hubtty works seamlessly offline or online.  All of the actions that it
performs are first recorded in a local database (in ``~/.hubtty.db``
by default), and are then transmitted to Github.  If Hubtty is unable
to contact Github for any reason, it will continue to operate against
the local database, and once it re-establishes contact, it will
process any pending changes.

The status bar at the top of the screen displays the current number of
outstanding tasks that Hubtty must perform in order to be fully up to
date.  Some of these tasks are more complicated than others, and some
of them will end up creating new tasks (for instance, one task may be
to search for new pull requests in a repository which will then produce
5 new tasks if there are 5 new pull requests).

If Hubtty is offline, it will so indicate in the status bar.  It will
retry requests if needed, and will switch between offline and online
mode automatically.

If you review a pull request while offline with a positive vote, and someone
else leaves a negative vote on that pull request in the same category before
Hubtty is able to upload your review, Hubtty will detect the situation
and mark the pull request as "held" so that you may re-inspect the pull request
and any new comments before uploading the review.  The status bar will
alert you to any held pull requests and direct you to a list of them (the
`F12` key by default).  When viewing a pull request, the "held" flag may be
toggled with the exclamation key (`!`).  Once held, a pull request must be
explicitly un-held in this manner for your review to be uploaded.

If Hubtty encounters an error, this will also be indicated in the
status bar.  You may wish to examine ~/.hubtty.log to see what the
error was.  In many cases, Hubtty can continue after encountering an
error.  The error flag will be cleared when you leave the current
screen.

selecting the text.
